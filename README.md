# Windy Skew-T Plugin

This project generates Skew-T plots (and later hodographs) from meteorological data, e.g. data from windy.com soundings (real measurements and generated data)

# Further Steps
## Functionalities 
    
- create integral for CAPE (number and show)
- create integral for CIN (number and show)
- add CCL
- add LFC
- add LCL
- add EL
- add ConvT
- add wind
- add interactiveness
- add ALL
- add Flags for wind
- add hodograph

## Usability
- add curser lines (MALR, DALR, Mixed, Isobar)
- add x-axis and y-axis labels on hover
- dis/enable Functionalities with button
- Saving multiple versions of hover-State by clicking and marking it, also at different isobars

## Integration

- as windy.com plugin possible?
- create UI of some sort
